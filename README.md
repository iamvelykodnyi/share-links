# Share links

Customized sharing links

### For use

You need to download `docs/styles/share.css` and `docs/scripts/share.js` files and copy HTML markup from the docs/index.html file. Then add them to your project. For example look at the files in the `docs` directory.

If you need customized links, get code from `source` directory.
